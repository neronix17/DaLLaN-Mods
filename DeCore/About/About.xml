	<description>DeCore brings in a lot of changes in game mechanics, so the player have to think differently and use new colony development strategy.
		The mod makes the game significantly more comfortable to play and some of its aspects - more logical. The mod changes resources, apparel and production.
		The majority of changes were made using patches, so the chance of incompatibility with other mods is very low.
		This mod is the pack of small enhancements and adjustments that make the game better. Most of them were made by me; some were taken from other mods.
		DeCore may become an indispensable part of the game for someone. Perhaps, it will serve as base for many modpacks. Will see)
