	<description>As you may have noticed, animals trained to haul things are quite lazy and doing they work from time to time.
		This mod makes your animals more hardworking: all animals with hauling skill now haul items and resources a lot more often.
		Also hauling skill now requires 9 levels to be learned, instead of vanilla 7. It will take more time to train animals, but will finally repay with increased effectiveness.
		Having hauling animals is more profitable, and now they can serve as a real work force.

		The mod works on the old saves and doesn't require new game. There're no conflicts with other mods that change animals.
		If you already have animals with trained hauling, after installing the mod you will need to additionally train them from 7th to 9th hauling level.

		Special thanks: Hrosts</description>
